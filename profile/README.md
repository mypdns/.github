## Introduction

My Privacy DNS is an organization dedicated to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base on blacklisted domains across various DNS blacklist projects. Our primary goal is to collect and organize this information to provide clear insights into why certain domains are blacklisted. The secondary objective is to offer these blacklists through the [matrix repository](https://github.com/mypdns/matrix) as a direct reflection of the data gathered from [kb.mypdns.org/issues/MTX](https://kb.mypdns.org/issues/MTX), [matrix issues](https://github.com/mypdns/matrix/issues), and [mypdns.youtrack.cloud/issue/MTX](https://mypdns.youtrack.cloud/issue/MTX).

## Project Overview

The project originated from the need to understand the reasons behind domain blacklisting, as many projects tend to compile extensive lists without detailed explanations. As a result of the knowledge we collect, we build and maintain blacklists in the [matrix repository](https://github.com/mypdns/matrix).

### Key Features

- **DNS Firewall**: A handcrafted and self-managed DNS firewall through Response Policy Zones (RPZ) to protect users' privacy by blocking access to malicious domains and tracking servers.
- **Anti-Porn List**: A list that blocks access to pornographic and explicit sites, useful for parents to ensure children are not exposed to inappropriate content.
