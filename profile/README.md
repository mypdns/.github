My Privacy DNS is an organisation that aims to keep a knowledge base on domains that are blacklisted in any domain Blacklist project.

We have tried to start this a couple of times, but for various reasons, we have never found a stable solution to spread the KB, and therefor lost years of efforts. This is the 5 time we will try to accomplish this goal, and this time we try out GitHub as the issue board (Knowledge Base) for why domains are blacklisted.

The project started out because. I @spirillen got very tired, of not knowing why a domain was blacklisted, as many projects, just put everything into one file without any comments.

As results of the knowledge we collect, we do build and maintain blacklists in the [matrix](https://github.com/mypdns/matrix) repository.
